h1. Introduction

Open Source POS System in Ruby.

h2. Installation

To install you will need to run the following
 <pre>
bundle install
 </pre>

h2. Gui Creation

MelonPan utilizes WxWidget's XRC for GUI.
Simply generate the XRC file and put it in resources/Xrc/ 
and run
 <pre>
rake gui:generate:view
 <pre>

which will generate view ruby file to load the xrc.
Note: all files will be regenerated when you run the rake.

h2. Coding convention

We loosely follow the MVC paradime
 * Do not touch views directly, they should be generated by the rake task
 * Controllers should only handle events, business logic should be in models
 * More coming soon..
